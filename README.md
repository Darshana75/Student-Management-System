# Student-Management-System

This Student Management System is a simple web application for managing student data. It allows users to add new students by entering their full name, age, email, and phone number. The added students are displayed in a table below, with options to edit or delete each entry. Built with a user-friendly interface, this system can be used as a basic tool for schools or educational institutions to keep track of student information. Ideal for learning and demonstration purposes, this project showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in a clean, minimalistic layout.
